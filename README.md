### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Krishna Kishore. I work as a full-time programmer. In my spare time I do open-sourcing (normally it is about 1-2 hours). Most of my open-source projects are focused on one thing - to help people learn ðŸ“š. Basically i know a little about a lot.

When my father first started using a smartphone, he only used it to call. He didn't know/use other functionalities, such as looking up directions, until I taught him to orally speak to text or Operating TV with Voice. This led me to believe Natural Language Processing will bridge the gap between humans and modern technology.

My goal is to make Artificial Intelligence useful  in many ways . Language plays a crucial  role in our lives, if computers understand our language, using technology would be as simple as maintaining a conversation. I felt this experience when i was working as Research engineer in my previous company where users will be using Voice Assistant (Like Alexa) as a medium to talk with our applications and able to retrieve their information and also we were able to bring the FAQ Section to the voice assistant medium. 

My Previous work ended with many promising ideas and interest  in this field. I worked with the telecommunication sector and provided helpful insights like predicting the right plan for customers based on their traits. I will show  my remarkable effort  on my academic abilities and research work.

I even won a hackathon based on developing a Skill for Alexa. With minimal experience in AI. My goal in language technologies is to create solutions that are beneficial. To undertake longer-term research with contributions on par with my ambition, I need more research experience and a wider and deeper understanding of language technologies. I strongly believe that open source community is the best suited to help me realize my dream.
